  <p align="justify">
    The Office Activity (OA) dataset collected by us is a more complex activity dataset which covers the common daily
    activities happened in office. It is a large dataset with 1180 RGB-D activity sequences. To capture human
    activities in multi-views, we set three RGB-D sensors in different viewpoints for recording and each subject is
    asked to perform twice in one activity. To increase the variability of the activities, we record them in two
    different scenes, i.e., two different offices. More importantly, we not only consider the single human activity,
    but also deal with the problem with more than one people.</p>
  <p align="justify">
    The dataset consists of two parts: OA1 (activities performed by a single subject) and OA2 (activities performed by
    two subjects). In OA1, there are 10 classes of activities performed by five subjects, which include
    {answering-phones, arranging-files, eating, moving-objects, going-to-work, finding-objects, mopping, sleeping,
    taking-water, wandering}<a href="http://pan.baidu.com/share/link?shareid=3318235737&uk=3896509406">Demo</a>. In
    OA2, we have 10 activities involving two peoples as { asking-and-away, called-away, carrying, chatting, delivering,
    eating-and-chating, having-guest, seeking-help, shaking-hands, showing}<a href="http://pan.baidu.com/share/link?shareid=3320936954&uk=3896509406">Demo</a>.
